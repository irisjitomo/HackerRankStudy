# Intro to Linear Search

# How do we search?

- given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element in the array and check if its the value we want.

# Linear Search

PseudoCode:
- function accepts an array and a value
- loop through entire arrayand check if the current array element is equal to the value
- if it is, return the `index` at which the element is found
- if the value is not there, return -1
