# Problem Solving last step: REFACTOR!!!

# Looking back and refactoring

# Congrats on solving the problem, but youre not done yet

Its tempting to just stop what youre doing as soon as you hit MVP. Especially if youre trying to hit a deadline.
But its worth looking back and refactoring your code to become a better developer.

# Refactoring Questions
    - Can you check the result?
    - Can you derive the result differently?
    - Can you understand it at a glance?
    - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    - How have other people solved this problem?
