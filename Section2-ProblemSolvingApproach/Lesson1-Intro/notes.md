# Objectives:
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including `frequency counters`, `two pointer problems` and `divide and conquer`

# What is an algorithm?
A `process` or `set of steps` to `accomplish` a `certain task`.

# Why do I need to know this? 'SUPER IMPORTANT'
Almost `everything` that you do in programming involves some kind of `algorithm`.
Its the `foundation` for being a suuccessful problem solver and developer.
Also `INTERVIEWS`.

# How do you improve?
`Devise` a plan for solving problems
`Master` common problem solving patterns

# Problem Solving Strategies
`Understand` the problem
`Explore` Concrete Examples
`Break` it down
Solve/Simplify
Look back and `refactor`
