# Understand The Problem

Before Diving right in the problem, you have to understand it.
Take a step back and understand the problem

# Ask yourself these questions...
1. Can I `restate` the `problem` in my `own words`?
2. What are the `inputs` that go into the problem?
3. What are the `outputs` that should be `returned`?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I `have enough info` to `solve the problem`? (You may not be abe to answer this question until you set about solving the problem and thats okay; It's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
5. How should I `label` te `important pieces` of data that are part of the problem?

# Example: Write a function that takes two nums and return their sum....
1. Can I `restate` the `problem` in my `own words`?
`"addition of two nums"`

2. What are the `inputs` that go into the problem?
`This depends, they are numbers but are they integers? Floats? How large are the numbers?`

3. What are the `outputs` that should be `returned`?
`The sum of the inputs`

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I `have enough info` to `solve the problem`? (You may not be abe to answer this question until you set about solving the problem and thats okay; It's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
`Yes but it depends. What if there's only one num? Should we add a num to 0?`

5. How should I `label` te `important pieces` of data that are part of the problem?
`Add`
