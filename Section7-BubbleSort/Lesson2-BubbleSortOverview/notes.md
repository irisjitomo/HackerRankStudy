# Bubble Sort

- A sorting algorithm where the largest values `bubble up to the top`

# Bubble Sort Pseudocode

- Start looping with a var called i at the end of array towards beginning
- Start an inner loop with a var called j from the beginning until i - 1
- if arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two vals
- return sorted arr
