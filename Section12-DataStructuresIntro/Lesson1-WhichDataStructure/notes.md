# There are a lot of data structures

# What do they do?

- Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them and the functions or ops that can be applied to the data.

# Why so many??

- Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

# Why care?

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!
- and **INTERVIEWS**

# There is no `BEST` structure

- They all excel in different situations..
- Otherwise why bother learning them all?

# Working with map/location data?

- Use a graph!
