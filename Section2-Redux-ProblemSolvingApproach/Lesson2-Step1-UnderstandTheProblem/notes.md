Step 1 - Understanding the Problem

    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough info to solve the problem?
    5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?


Example:
    Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

Restate the problem: A function that adds two nums
Inputs of the problem: Integers or floats
What are the outputs of the problem: an integer
Can the outputs be determined from the inputs: Yes, a + b = c
How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problems
