Step 3 - Break It Down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

- This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or midunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details

- Example:
    Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string

def charCount(str):
    // do something
    // edge case: if input is not string, then return Error
    // Make object to return
    // loop through each char of string
        // if element in iteration is not a key, add it as key with a 1
        // elif element in iteration is a key, add 1
    // return an object with keys with lowercase alpha-numeric characters in the string
