# Hash Tables
    - Also known as Hash Maps

# Objectives  
    - Explain what a hash table is 
    - Define hashing algorithm
    - Discuss what makes a good hashing algorithm
    - Understand how collsions occur
    - How to deal with collisions

# What is a hash table?

    - Hash tables are used to store `key-value` pairs

    - They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered

    - Unlike arrays, hashtables are fast for all operations

# Why should I care?

    - Nearly every programming language hash some sort of hash table data structure

    - Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used

# Hash Tables in the wild
    - Python - Dict()
    - JS - Objects and Maps*
    - Java, Go, and Scala have Maps
    - Ruby has... Hashes
