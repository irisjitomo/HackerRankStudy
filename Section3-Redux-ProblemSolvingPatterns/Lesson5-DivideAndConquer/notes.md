Divide and Conquer

The pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating process with a subset of data

This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity


An Example

Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the vlaue passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1
