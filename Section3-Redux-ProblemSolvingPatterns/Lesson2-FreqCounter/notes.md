Frequency Counters

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/freq of values

An Example:

Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return True if every value in the array has its coresponding value SQUARED in the second array. The freq of values must be the same.

same([1,2,3], [4,1,9]) // true
same([1,2,3], [2,3]) // false
